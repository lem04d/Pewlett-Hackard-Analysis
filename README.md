#Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis

#Purpose
Quantifying retiring employees and the impact on the business

  The purpose of this analysis is to determine how many employees are retiring and from which positions. In addition, we will identify which employees who are eligible to to take part in a mentorship program. By gathering data from multiple data sources, we are able to see which employees are due to retire and from what positions/departments. The second part of our analysis is identifying those who are qualified by age and date of hire for a mentorship program. 

#Results:
There are a large number of employees due to retire from senior level positons and not a robust pipeline for replacement 

-Out of over 300,000 employees, over 90,000 are due to retire 
-The most common titles due to retire are those of senior positions which indicates that there may be a vacuum of leadership roles once those eligible for retirement decide to leave
- When we look at the list of those eligible for the mentorship program, there will still be a large gap in the number of vacant postions and those eligible to fill them. 
- Pewlett Hackard exectutives will need to look into other options for recruitment to these soon-to-be vacant senior positions 

#Summary:

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Over 90,000 positions, most in senior levels, will need to be filled once the "tsumani" begins to make an impact

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
No. There are far too few eligibile to mentor employees to step into these senior level roles.
